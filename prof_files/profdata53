The class can easily fail, and require more work than necessary. I wonder why he's still teaching.  Breaks my self-esteem when I ask a question, make me look stupid every time. :(",

I don't know why some crazy students complaint about having to know the definitions of terms, for me, I see no problem at all. The TA was awesome, he helped us a great deal too! I highly recommend taking CMPT 275 with him!",
