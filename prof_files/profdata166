Got more than 100% on final exam (if a lot of ppl screw up on a question she either makes it a bonus, or omits it) Although I had programming experience, looking at her slow pace and helpfulness, I dont see why beginners should have any probz...esp if they find a smart partner for the Labs/Projs!",
